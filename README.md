# Weather App

This Angular project is a weather application that provides real-time weather information and a 7-day forecast. It allows users to search for a specific city and view the current temperature along with a detailed forecast for the upcoming week. By developing this project, I gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Angular, including component creation, data binding, and API integration. Through this hands-on experience, I enhanced my skills in building dynamic web applications using the Angular framework.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
